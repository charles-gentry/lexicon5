# Lexicon5

Lexicon5 is a lightweight word puzzle built around a 5×5 grid. Tap a loose letter to drop it into the highlighted cell of the central column. Tap a cell again to return its letter to the pool. Fill each row with a valid five‑letter word so the central column reveals the secret keyword. Hit **New Puzzle!** any time for a fresh challenge.
